* WSAD to move
* Mouse to aim
* Left click to shoot

Every time you shoot, you leave a blue ice blob on the ground.  If you're 
standing on a blue blob, you'll move more slowly and you won't be able to shoot
until you move off of the blob.  Kill as many polar bears as you can before you 
run out of space!
